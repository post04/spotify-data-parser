# Description

When you request your data from spotify they give you a bunch of files, some of which are called "StreamingHistory0.json", these aren't easy to read as a human so I made a tool to make it easy to visualize just how much music you listen to.

# How to

```
$ git clone https://github.com/postrequest69/spotify-data-parser.git
```

If you don't know how to get your spotify data you can [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghs9XMdvBXg). 

Put your "spotify data" folder in your project folder.

```
$ go run main.go
```

Easy to use!
